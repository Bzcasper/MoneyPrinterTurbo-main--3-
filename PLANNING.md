# Directory Organization Plan

## Task Overview
Organize the MoneyPrinterTurbo-main (3) project directory for clarity, maintainability, and scalability. No files or code will be deleted. All changes will be documented and tracked according to strict workflow rules.

## Steps
1. Analyze current directory structure and identify areas for improvement.
2. Propose a new, logical directory structure based on project architecture and best practices.
3. Move files and folders to appropriate locations, ensuring all references and imports remain valid.
4. Update documentation to reflect new structure.
5. Test application to ensure functionality is preserved.
6. Update TODO.md with progress and completion status.

## Expected Outcomes
- Improved clarity and maintainability of the project directory.
- No loss of code or assets.
- All changes tracked and documented.

## Required Resources
- Access to the full project directory
- Knowledge of project architecture and dependencies

## Timeline
- Planning: Immediate
- Execution: 1-2 hours
- Testing & Documentation: 1 hour

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Broken imports/references:** Mitigate by updating all affected paths and testing thoroughly.
- **Loss of context:** Mitigate by documenting all moves and changes in TODO.md and README.md.
- **Merge conflicts:** Mitigate by working on a dedicated branch and merging only after full testing.

## Compliance
All steps will strictly follow the rules in RULES.instructions.md, including branch management, documentation, and task tracking.
