# Video Processing Pipeline - Implementation TODO

## üìã Current Status Analysis

### ‚úÖ Completed Components
- **Processing Pipeline**: Complete parallel video processing with resource management
- **Concatenation Service**: Multiple concatenation strategies with format analysis  
- **Memory Manager**: Intelligent memory management with cleanup and caching
- **Core Orchestrator**: Workflow coordination with mock components for testing
- **Performance Monitor**: Referenced but implementation needed
- **Security Framework**: Complete with config, auth, validation, and audit

### üîß Missing Critical Components

#### 1. Video Validation Engine (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Create `app/services/video/validation/engine.py`
- [ ] Input file validation (format, size, corruption)
- [ ] Output validation after processing
- [ ] Security validation (malicious file detection)
- [ ] Codec and format compatibility checks

#### 2. Performance Monitor Implementation 
- [ ] Complete `app/services/video/monitoring/performance.py`
- [ ] Real-time metrics collection
- [ ] Workflow performance tracking
- [ ] Resource utilization monitoring
- [ ] Performance reporting and alerts

#### 3. Integration Fixes
- [ ] Fix orchestrator mock components with real implementations
- [ ] Connect validation engine to processing pipeline
- [ ] Integrate performance monitoring throughout workflow
- [ ] Add proper error handling and logging

#### 4. Configuration Management
- [ ] Create video processing configuration schema
- [ ] Environment-based settings (no hardcoded values)
- [ ] Quality presets and encoding profiles
- [ ] Resource limit configurations

#### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Unit tests for validation engine
- [ ] Integration tests for complete workflow
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Error handling test scenarios

## üéØ Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Validation (IMMEDIATE)
1. Implement VideoValidationEngine
2. Add file format validation
3. Connect to orchestrator workflow

### Phase 2: Performance & Monitoring
1. Complete PerformanceMonitor implementation
2. Add real-time metrics collection
3. Integrate monitoring into pipeline

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
1. Replace mock components in orchestrator
2. End-to-end workflow testing
3. Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
1. Configuration management
2. Error handling improvements
3. Documentation completion

## üîç Quality Standards
- All files ‚â§ 500 lines
- No hardcoded environment values
- Comprehensive error handling
- Security input validation
- TDD approach where applicable
- Clean architecture principles
