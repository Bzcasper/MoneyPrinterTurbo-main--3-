## Recommendation

1. **KEEP**: `claude-flow`, `claude-flow.bat`, `claude-flow.ps1`
   - These are legitimate CLI tools that provide cross-platform support
   - They contain important wrapper logic for the AI development toolkit

2. **DELETE**: All PostScript files named after Python modules
   - These appear to be incorrectly generated image files
   - They're taking up significant disk space (over 1.5GB total)
   - They conflict with actual Python module names
   - They serve no purpose in a software project

3. **UPDATE**: .gitignore and .dockerignore
   - Add patterns to prevent these types of files from being tracked in the future
   - Ensure build artifacts and generated files are properly excluded
